# Student Submission: Text Adventure Agent

> Replace this with your name and student ID

## Overview

This is my submission for the Text Adventure Agent assignment. My agent uses the ReAct pattern to play text adventure games via MCP.

## Approach

<!-- Describe your approach here -->

- What strategy does your agent use?
- What tools did you implement in your MCP server?
- Any interesting techniques or optimizations?

## Files

- `agent.py` - ReAct agent implementation
- `mcp_server.py` - MCP server with game tools
- `requirements.txt` - Additional dependencies (if any)

## Local Testing

```bash
# Test the MCP server
fastmcp dev mcp_server.py

# Run the agent
python agent.py
```
